Hey!

I'm submitting this because it's due, but I still feel like the design needs work. As of right now, I believe it's functional, and fullfills the requirements. It just doesn't LOOK right to me lol Maybe it's the color pallette, maybe it's the layout, or maybe I've just been looking at it for too long. Anyway, any and all feedback, will really help!
